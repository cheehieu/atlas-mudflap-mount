# Overview
I have owned an Alti-2 N3 altimeter for many years. It is traditionally worn on the wrist (like a watch) to indicate a skydiver's current altitude while they are in freefall. I started wingsuit skydiving recently, which requires the altimeter to be mounted somewhere more visible during full flight, such as the parachute's chest strap or mudflap. Naturally, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a new altimeter and fancy mount. So I tried finding a cheaper alternative.
